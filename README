* Jesse Weisbeck has built this crossword puzzle to provide an enhanced, more intuitive user experience with javascript.
* @TheRealDod tweaked it a bit and changed the content to EFF's Xmas 2013 NSA puzzle.

Note: this fork doesn't show definition numbers (positions) inside the puzzle, because it got buggy.
Feel free to fix this :)
