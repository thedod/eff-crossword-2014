1. [Jesse Weisbeck](http://www.jesseweisbeck.com/) has built this crossword puzzle to provide an enhanced, more intuitive user experience with javascript.
1. [Ash Kyd](http://ash.ms/) did bug fixes and added cool features (e.g. the "reveal a random letter" cheat).
1. [The Dod](http://thedod.github.io) added rot13 (against accidental peeking) and an example puzzle that uses it (EFF's [Xmas 2013 NSA puzzle](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/crossword-what-did-we-learn-about-nsa-year)).

Your turn :)
